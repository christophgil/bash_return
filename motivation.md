# Motivation

The *return* command in Bash is usually used to return *EXIT_SUCCESS* or an  error code from function.
It can only return integers between 0 and 255. It  is not applicable to pass strings or numeric values from the function to the caller.


Strings or numeric values are often  printed to standard output by function. The caller can easily capture the standard output. See
section *Returning Strings* in https://ioflood.com/blog/bash-function-return-value

    function square() {
        echo $(($1*$1))
    }
    echo "The square of 3 is $(square 3)"

This looks nice and  compact. However, it wastes about a millisecond which leads to long running loops.
A serious risk is that output generated by commands inside the function  get  also captured, when the programmer forgets a redirection to */dev/stderr*.
This may happen upon  code  refactoring.

Alternative strategies have been  discussed to improve performance based on variables without involving */dev/stdout*: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3236871/how-to-return-a-string-value-from-a-bash-function

The following is much faster:

    function square() {
       RETVAL=$(($1*$1))
    }
    square  value 3;  s=$RETVAL
    echo "The square of 3 is $s"

The code correctly prints the square of the number 3. It is slightly more verbose.
In functions with several return statements the programmer must not forget to assign the variable RETVAL.
This is particular important if the same variable is used for different functions.


It would be nice to have the choice between both.

Therefore the extension  has been implemented as a bash-builtin in C.
